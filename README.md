# Headlines

A simple offline first app, using Service workers, IndexedDb and [The news API](newsapi.org)

To run this app locally, start by cloning this repo

```
  git@github.com:CEOehis/headlines.git
```

The build files are included in this repo already. So simply install a web server (if you don't have one already) and serve the app.
```
  npm install -global serve
  serve -s build
```

or

```
  yarn global add serve
  serve -s build
```

To extend the functionallity you would need to install the dependecies using:
```
  npm install
```

or


```
  yarn
```



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
